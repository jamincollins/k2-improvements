# Moonraker

## Why

The version of Moonraker on the K2 is old (how old?) and missing features like:

* log rotation.
* Home Assistant integration

The updated Moonraker version also brings with it access to other integrations such as:

* [SimplyPrint](https://simplyprint.io/)

## Log Rotation

Being able to rotate your `klippy.log` and `moonraker.log` files helps in reducing the size of the files when asking for help or reporting an issue.

## Home Assistant

While not a core feature of Moonraker, there's something the Home Assistant integration is looking for that is missing from the Moonraker version on the K2.  Just another added benefit of updating.
